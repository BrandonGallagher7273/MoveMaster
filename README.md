# MoveMaster 


## Overview
MoveMaster was established with the objective of leveraging physics and machine learning to identify the most optimal move set for winning popular online and tabletop games. 
Depending on which game is selected, MoveMaster will allow the user to specify various parameters that influence gameplay. 
In Jenga, for instance, a user will be able to specify parameters like the coefficient of friction between the blocks, the weight of a block, the acceleration of gravity, and the current state of the game (i.e., whether the game is just starting, or the game is currently in progress).  
After all parameters are set, the software will produce the best possible move that a player could make. 
Considering the computational complexity associated with machine learning, MoveMaster will be developed as a desktop application. Python will be our primary development language, as it offers a number of libraries and frameworks that simplify the implementation of machine learning models.


## Goals
Because this is a new project, our goals for this semester are to create a basic working model for a single tabletop gameâ€” Jenga. 
We will first need to develop an interface in which modeling and simulating games will be possible. 
The next step would be creating a physics engine capable of modeling a game of Jenga, followed by developing and training a basic artificial intelligence model to calculate the next move with the highest probability of success. 
Since training this model will require supervised learning techniques, we anticipate spending quite some time on this step in particular.
Each of these objectives is essential to our overall goal of producing a working model by the end of the semester. By systematically developing the interface, physics engine, and AI model, we will lay a strong foundation so that our work may be expanded upon in future semesters.
